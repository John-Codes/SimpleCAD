Development Tasks for Minimalist 2D Sketch and Extrusion Tool
Below is a step-by-step sequence of tasks to develop a minimalist TypeScript JavaScript web application for 2D sketching and extrusion, inspired by Fusion 360, with a sleek UI, snapping grid, and 3D view capabilities.
Task 1: Project Setup

Objective: Initialize the project with TypeScript and necessary dependencies.
Steps:
Set up a TypeScript project with tsconfig.json for a web-based application.
Install dependencies: Three.js for 3D rendering and a 2D canvas library (e.g., Konva.js) for sketching.
Create an index.html file with a basic structure and link to https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/three.js/r128/three.min.js.
Ensure the app runs in a browser environment without local file I/O or network calls.
Configure a dark theme with a body gradient (linear-gradient(135deg, #1a1a2e, #16213e)).



Task 2: Implement Basic UI Structure

Objective: Create the minimalist UI layout with a sidebar and viewport.
Steps:
The default mode for the UI is 3d view mode and select object or face of object for extrusion or sketching. When the sketch button is pressed then we exit 3d mode and go in to 2d sketch mode.
Structure the HTML with a flex container (.container) for a sidebar (280px) and viewport (flex: 1).
Style the sidebar with a blurred background (backdrop-filter: blur(10px), rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3)), border (rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)), and padding (20px).
Style the viewport with a radial gradient (circle at center, #0f3460, #0a1a2a).
Add a status bar at the bottom of the viewport with a blurred background (backdrop-filter: blur(10px), rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4)), displaying mode indicator (#64b5f6), coordinates, and snap info (12px, #b0bec5).
Add two canvases: one for 2D sketching (canvas2d) and one for 3D rendering (canvas3d, initially hidden and shadow (0 0 30px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)).
When in 2d mode the 2d canvas appears next to the menu and covers the remaining screen.when in 3d mode the 3d canvas appears next to the menu and covers the remainign screen.By default we start in 2d mode 
Have a settings button with a settings menu that has a screen that lets you just input your 3d printers build area in X Y Z planes. So what ever is inside this will be a blue grid with dark blue background. what ever is out will be a red grid with dark red background.
The settings button will always be visible in both modes 2d and 3d mode.

Task 3: Implement Sidebar Components

Objective: Build the sidebar sections for objects, tools, settings, view, and information. Some tools will only be visible in 3d view where you can also select and move objects or select object faces.
 Other tools will only be visible in 2d sketch mode.
Steps:
Sketch section with a "Sketch" button (green, rgba(76, 175, 80, 0.2), hover: rgba(76, 175, 80, 0.3)) This is only visible in 3d mode and takes you to 2d mode and lets you create a new object from the middle of the grid in XYZ.
Implement an object list displaying each object’s name, and color indicator, styled with rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.05), rounded corners (6px), and hover/selected states (#64b5f6) This should onjly be visible in 3d mode.
Add extrude (#2196f3)  button will be visible only when an object is selected with a mouse click on one of the objects faces in 3d mode not in 2d sketch mode. Can extrude positively or negatively removing material.
Create a "Tools" section (hidden by default) with a "Line Tool" button (#64b5f6) and "Finish Sketch" button, styled with rgba(100, 181, 246, 0.1), rounded corners (8px), and hover effects. Only visible in 2d mode.
Add a "Settings" section with inputs for snap distance, construction distance, and styled with rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1), white text, and focus state (#64b5f6 glow).
Add a "View" section with "Reset View".
Add an "Information" section for contextual help text (11px, #90a4ae).
The default snap distance for the grid should be 1mm.
In the information part just put a link to YT.
Create a 3d cube 20mm x 20mmm x 20mmm to test the move object and rotate object and selected face in  3d mode. So when a face is selected the sketch buttopn appears and then we can implement the sketch functionality
The data for the items list should have the color name and have the actual object in 2d or 3d when  a sketch operation is performed on the object it should be saved on the list or when a extrude operation is performed it should be saved on the list by creating a new copy of the item with the operation be it extrusion or sketch one operation per copy. 
The 3d mode should be like a regular cad 3d view a X plane grid colored red.  a Z Plane grid colored green for front and back. and a Y colored blue for up and down.
and when a face is selected you must higlit it when it is clicked on by the user in 3d mode.

Remove the grids below the floor in the Y plane In 3d printing its not possible to print below the print bed so no need for grids below the print bed.


Task 4: Implement 2D Canvas and Grid

Objective: Set up the 2D sketching canvas with a 1mm snapping grid.
Steps:
Initialize the 2D canvas (canvas2d) using Konva.js or HTML5 Canvas, scaled at 2 pixels per mm.
Implement a 1mm square snapping grid, styled with rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) lines (1px width).
Add a toggle for grid visibility (e.g., via a button in the settings section).
Ensure the canvas resizes dynamically with the viewport, maintaining the grid scale.



Task 5: Implement Line Drawing Mechanics

Objective: Enable line drawing with mouse and keyboard input.
Steps:
Implement line creation:
First click sets the start point; the line follows the mouse cursor.
Second click finalizes the line’s end point.


Allow mouse dragging to adjust line length and angle dynamically.
On pressing Tab, toggle between length and angle input in a floating box.
Style the floating box with rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8) background, #64b5f6 border, rounded corners (4px), and white text (11px).
Ensure the floating box is compact and does not obstruct the canvas view.
Draw preview lines with a dashed pattern (5,5, #64b5f6, 2px width, 0.8 opacity).
Store lines in the current object’s data structure.



Task 6: Implement Snapping and Construction Lines

Objective: Add snapping to grid and geometry with construction line feedback.
Steps:
Implement snapping to:
1mm grid points.
Endpoints, midpoints, and edges of nearby lines (regardless of distance).


Highlight snap points with a green circle (#4caf50, 10px radius), white crosshair, and shadow (drop-shadow(0 0 10px #4caf50)).
Display snap type (‘C’ for center, ‘E’ for endpoint, ‘M’ for edge) in white 10px text above the snap point.
Draw construction lines for:
Endpoints (blue, #42a5f5).
Midpoints (orange, #ffa726).
Edges (purple, #ab47bc).
Parallel alignments or proximity to endpoints.


Style construction lines with 1px width, dashed pattern (3,3), and opacity varying by distance (0.3 to 1.0).
Display snap info in the status bar (e.g., “Snap endpoint: x, y”).



Task 7: Implement Sketch Finalization and Extrusion

Objective: Allow users to finalize a sketch and extrude it into a 3D object.
Steps:
Add a “Finish Sketch” button in the tools section to exit sketch mode and show extrusion options.
Display an input field in the sidebar for extrusion depth (in mm), hidden during sketch mode.
Convert the 2D sketch into a 3D object using Three.js’s ExtrudeGeometry with the specified depth.
Store the 3D object in the current object’s data structure, marking it as 3D.
Automatically switch to 3D view (canvas3d) after extrusion, hiding canvas2d.



Task 8: Implement 3D View and Interaction

Objective: Set up the 3D view with navigation controls and surface selection.
Steps:
Initialize Three.js with a scene, perspective camera, and WebGL renderer.
Set the 3D canvas background to #0a1a2a.
Add lighting: ambient (0x404040, 0.6 intensity), directional (0xffffff, 0.8 intensity), and point light (#64b5f6, 0.3 intensity).
Implement 3D view controls:
Rotate via mouse drag (horizontal and vertical, limit vertical to ±90°).
Zoom via mouse wheel (range: 0.3 to 5).


Enable clicking on a 3D object’s surface to select it for further extrusion or sketching.
Update the sidebar to show options for the selected surface (extrude or new sketch).



Task 9: Implement Surface-Based Sketching and Extrusion

Objective: Allow sketching and extrusion on a selected 3D surface.
Steps:
Prompt the user extrude selected area or sketch.
When a surface is selected for sketching, project the 3D surface onto a 2D plane for sketching.
Reuse the 2D sketching interface (line drawing, snapping, grid) on the selected surface.
Allow finalizing the new sketch and extruding it to modify the 3D object.
If extrude selected surface is selected. Support additional extrusion of the selected surface by specifying a new depth in positive or negative to remove material from the surface just like fusion 360.
Update the 3D object in the canvas after each operation.



Task 10: Enhance Object Management

Objective: Implement object creation, selection, and deletion.
Steps:
Allow creating new objects via the “Create New Sketch” button, initializing a new sketch.
Display objects in the sidebar list with name, color indicator, and buttons for deletion.
Enable selecting an object face to enter sketch mode (if 2D) or view its 3D model and move or rotate the entire 3d object with the mouse in an intuitive simple way like thinkercad.
Implement deletion, removing the object from the list and scene.
Update the object list dynamically after each action.



Task 11: Finalize and Test

Objective: Ensure the application is polished and functional.
Steps:
Test line drawing, snapping, and construction lines for accuracy and responsiveness.
Verify extrusion and 3D view functionality, including surface selection and iterative sketching.
Ensure UI elements (sidebar, buttons, inputs, status bar) are responsive and visually consistent.
Confirm compatibility with modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
Optimize performance for smooth rendering of 2D and 3D canvases.
Validate that extrusion options remain hidden during sketch mode.
